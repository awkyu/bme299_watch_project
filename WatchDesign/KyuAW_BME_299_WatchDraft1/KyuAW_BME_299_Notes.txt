Notes on Watch Design:

Hey Ryan,

A picture of the Assembly is in folder too for reference.  All of the parts that need to be printed are named correctly.
    Not all pieces are mated, but was just the idea of how it was suppose to look after assembling it.

For the aesthetic, could you print the KyuAW_BME_299_Connector.stl in red and print everything else in white?

    I know that printing some of these pieces would be hard, especially the top piece, and both the right and intermediate band.  
    Is this still possible? Or do you have and ideas of how to fix this?
    In the assembly/parts, do you see any immediate fixes?
